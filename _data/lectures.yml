- title: Privacy and Legal Aspects of Immutable Blockchains
  contents:
    - name: Description
      value: This advanced seminar probes the multifaceted nature of blockchains, in particular at the interface between IT security and law. Blockchains allow the embedding of illicit content, such as child abuse material, which &#8212; due to their immutability &#8212; causes legal issues. The seminar discusses the technical possibilities for embedding and, in cooperation with legal science, also the legal consequences of undesirable content. Through this interplay of computer science and law, the learning objective is to be able to evaluate approaches to removing illegal content from a technical and legal perspective.
