  abstract={In digital forensics, the provenance of data being used as digital evidence in court is frequently challenged. This is often done to raise doubts about whether the possession of some piece of illegal data was intentional. However, there may also be situations where the provenance of data is legitimately questioned, such as in the case of second-hand devices that were not well sanitized. This may also lead to the disclosure of personal or corporate data. While poor sanitization practices have already been observed for second-hand hard disk drives, this has not yet been reported for new storage devices based on flash technology. Based on insights into the second-hand chip market in certain countries, we report on the results of the first large-scale study on the effects of chip reuse for USB flash drives. We provide clear evidence of poor sanitization practices for USB flash drives from the low-cost market that were sold as new. More specifically, we forensically analyzed 1211 low-cost USB flash drives and were able to recover non-trivial data on a total of 76 devices (6\%). Furthermore, we forensically analyzed 435 high-cost USB flash drives on which we could not find any evidence of chip recycling in this market sector.},

 abstract = {Democracy requires transparency. Consequently, courts of law must publish their decisions. At the same time, the interests of the persons involved in these court decisions must be protected. For this reason, court decisions in Europe are anonymized using a variety of techniques. To understand how well these techniques protect the persons involved, we conducted an empirical experiment with 54 law students, whom we asked to de-anonymize 50 German court decisions. We found that all anonymization techniques used in these court decisions were vulnerable, most notably the use of initials. Since even supposedly secure anonymization techniques proved vulnerable, our work empirically reveals the complexity involved in the anonymization of court decisions, and thus calls for further research to increase anonymity while preserving comprehensibility. Toward that end, we provide recommendations for improving anonymization quality. Finally, we provide an empirical notion of “reasonable effort,” to flesh out the definition of anonymity in the legal context. In doing so, we bridge the gap between the technical and the legal understandings of anonymity.},

 abstract= {In recent years, cryptocurrencies have increasingly been used in cybercrime and have become the key means of payment in darknet marketplaces, partly due to their alleged anonymity. Furthermore, the research attacking the anonymity of even those cryptocurrencies that claim to offer anonymity by design is growing and is being applied by law enforcement agencies in the fight against cybercrime. Their investigative measures require a certain degree of suspicion and it is unclear whether findings resulting from attacks on cryptocurrencies’ anonymity can indeed establish that required degree of suspicion. The reason for this is that these attacks are partly based upon uncertain assumptions which are often not properly addressed in the corresponding papers. To close this gap, we extract the assumptions in papers that are attacking Bitcoin, Monero and Zcash, major cryptocurrencies used in darknet markets which have also received the most attention from researchers. We develop a taxonomy to capture the different nature of those assumptions in order to help investigators to better assess whether the required degree of suspicion for specific investigative measures could be established. We found that assumptions based on user behaviour are in general the most unreliable and thus any findings of attacks based on them might not allow for intense investigative measures such as pre-trial detention. We hope to raise awareness of the problem so that in the future there will be fewer unlawful investigations based upon uncertain assumptions and thus fewer human rights violations.},

 abstract = {CoinJoin is the predominant means to enhance privacy in non-private cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. The basic idea of CoinJoin is to create transactions that combine equal-valued coins of multiple users. This mixing of coins aims to prevent linkage of the users’ transactional in- and outputs. The cryptocurrency Dash employs a built-in CoinJoin service and, therefore, is ideal for empirically studying CoinJoin. This paper presents the first empirical analysis of Dash, which reveals that over 40 \% of all private transactions can be de-anonymized depending on underlying assumptions. The main issue of these attacks is the coin-aggregation problem, i.e. the need to combine outputs of several CoinJoin transactions. The coin aggregation problem is not specific to Dash and affects other cryptocurrencies as empirical evidence in Bitcoin suggests. We show that the logical solution to the problem, namely CoinJoin transactions with non-fixed arbitrary values, suffers from other privacy weaknesses. We propose a novel mixing algorithm to mitigate the need for coin aggregation without introducing additional privacy vulnerabilities. In contrast to prior mixing algorithms, our approach removes the need for fixed values by dynamically creating equal-valued CoinJoin transactions. The mixing algorithm is not specific to Dash, and integration into other cryptocurrencies, especially into Bitcoin, is possible.},

 abstract = {Background: The development of Precision Medicine strategies requires high-dimensional phenotypic and genomic data, both of which are highly privacy-sensitive data types. Conventional data management systems lack the capabilities to sufficiently handle the expected large quantities of such sensitive data in a secure manner. PROMISE is a genetic data management concept that implements a highly secure platform for data exchange while preserving patient interests, privacy, and autonomy. Methods: The concept of PROMISE to democratize genetic data was developed by an interdisciplinary team. It integrates a sophisticated cryptographic concept that allows only the patient to grant selective access to defined parts of his genetic information with single DNA base-pair resolution cryptography. The PROMISE system was developed for research purposes to evaluate the concept in a pilot study with nineteen cardiomyopathy patients undergoing genotyping, questionnaires, and longitudinal follow-up. Results: The safety of genetic data was very important to 79 \%, and patients generally regarded the data as highly sensitive. More than half the patients reported that their attitude towards the handling of genetic data has changed after using the PROMISE app for 4 months (median). The patients reported higher confidence in data security and willingness to share their data with commercial third parties, including pharmaceutical companies (increase from 5 to 32 \%). Conclusion: PROMISE democratizes genomic data by a transparent, secure, and patient-centric approach. This clinical pilot study evaluating a genetic data infrastructure is unique and shows that patient’s acceptance of data sharing can be increased by patient-centric decision-making.},

 abstract = {As an alternative for the computational waste generated by proof-of-work (PoW) blockchains, proof-of-stake (PoS) systems gained a lot of popularity, being adopted by many existing cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, as we show, PoS-based currencies, where newly minted coins are assigned to the slot leader, inevitably incentivises coin hoarding, as players maximise their utility by holding their stakes and not trading. As a result, existing PoS-based cryptocurrencies do not mimic the properties of fiat currencies, but are rather regarded as investment vectors. <br><br>
In this work we initiate the study of minting mechanisms in cryptocurrencies as a primitive on its own right, and as a first step to a solution to mitigate coin hoarding in PoS currencies we propose a novel minting mechanism based on waiting-time first-price auctions. Our main technical tool is a protocol to run an auction over any blockchain. Moreover, our protocol is the first to securely implement an auction without requiring a semi-trusted party, i.e., where every miner in the network is a potential bidder. Our approach is generically applicable and we show that it is incentive-compatible with the underlying blockchain, i.e., the best strategy for a player is to behave honestly. Our proof-of-concept implementation shows that our system is efficient and scales to tens of thousands of bidders.},

 abstract = {An individual's genetic information is possibly the most valuable 
personal information. While knowledge of a person's DNA sequence can 
facilitate the diagnosis of several heritable diseases and allow 
personalized treatment, its exposure comes with significant threats to 
the patient's privacy. Currently known solutions for privacy-respecting 
computation require the owner of the DNA to either be heavily involved 
in the execution of a cryptographic protocol or to completely outsource 
the access control to a third party. This motivates the demand for 
cryptographic protocols which enable computation over encrypted genomic 
data while keeping the owner of the genome in full control. We envision a
 scenario where data owners can exercise arbitrary and dynamic access 
policies, depending on the intended use of the analysis results and on 
the credentials of who is conducting the analysis. At the same time, 
they are not required to maintain a local copy of their entire genetic 
data and do not need to exhaust their computational resources in an 
expensive cryptographic protocol. <br><br>In this work, we present METIS, a system that assists the computation 
over encrypted data stored in the cloud while leaving the decision on 
admissible computations to the data owner. A critical feature of our 
system is that the data owner is free from computational overload and 
her communication complexity is independent of the size of the input 
data and only linear in the size of the circuit's output. METIS is based
 on garbled circuits and supports any polynomially-computable function. 
We demonstrate the practicality of our approach with an implementation 
and an evaluation of several functions over real dataset.},

 abstract = {Bitcoin is an immutable permissionless blockchain system that has been extensively used as a public bulletin board by many different applications that heavily relies on its immutability. However, Bitcoin's immutability is not without its fair share of demerits. Interpol exposed the existence of harmful and potentially illegal documents, images and links in the Bitcoin blockchain, and since then there have been several qualitative and quantitative analysis on the types of data currently residing in the Bitcoin blockchain.
Although there is a lot of attention on blockchains, surprisingly the previous solutions proposed for data redaction in the permissionless setting are far from feasible, and require additional trust assumptions. Hence, the problem of harmful data still poses a huge challenge for law enforcement agencies like Interpol (Tziakouris, IEEE S&P'18). <br><br> We propose the first efficient redactable blockchain for the permissionless setting that is easily integrable into Bitcoin, and that does not rely on heavy cryptographic tools or trust assumptions. Our protocol uses a consensus-based voting and is parameterised by a policy that dictates the requirements and constraints for the redactions; if a redaction gathers enough votes the operation is performed on the chain. As an extra feature, our protocol offers public verifiability and accountability for the redacted chain. Moreover, we provide formal security definitions and proofs showing that our protocol is secure against redactions that were not agreed by consensus. Additionally, we show the viability of our approach with a proof-of-concept implementation that shows only a tiny overhead in the chain validation of our protocol when compared to an immutable one.},

 abstract ={A functional credential allows a user to anonymously prove possession of a set of attributes that fulfills a certain policy. The policies are arbitrary polynomially computable predicates that are evaluated over arbitrary attributes. The key feature of this primitive is the delegation of verification to third parties, called designated verifiers. The delegation protects the privacy of the policy: A designated verifier can verify that a user satisfies a certain policy without learning anything about the policy itself. We illustrate the usefulness of this property in different applications, including outsourced databases with access control. We present a new framework to construct functional credentials that does not require (non-interactive) zero-knowledge proofs. This is important in settings where the statements are complex and thus the resulting zero-knowledge proofs are not efficient. Our construction is based on any predicate encryption scheme and the security relies on standard assumptions. A complexity analysis and an experimental evaluation confirm the practicality of our approach.},
