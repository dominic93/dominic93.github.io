I am an IT security researcher focusing on anonymity and privacy (including cryptocurrencies). In particular, I am interested in topics at the interface of technology and law, which is why I started to study law in 2018 alongside my research.

In 2023, I received my Ph.D. (Dr.-Ing.) at the [Chair of Applied Cryptography](https://www.chaac.tf.fau.eu/), [Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg](https://www.fau.de/), under the supervision of [Dominique Schröder](https://www.dominique-schroeder.de/).
During my Ph.D., I was fortunate to be part of the [Research Training Group 2475: Cybercrime and Forensic Computing](https://www.cybercrime.fau.de/research-training-group-2475-cybercrime-and-forensic-computing/) by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG).
Besides, I am grateful that I had the opportunity to join and collaborate with [Nicolas Christin](https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/nicolasc/) and his group at [Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)](https://www.cmu.edu/).

In 2017, I received my M.Sc. in computer science from [Saarland University](https://www.uni-saarland.de/en/home.html), where I also graduated in 2015 with a B.Sc. in bioinformatics (majoring in computational molecular biology).
During my studies, I worked as a student trainee in software development and as a research assistant at the [Helmholtz Center for Information Security (CISPA)](https://cispa.de/en).
